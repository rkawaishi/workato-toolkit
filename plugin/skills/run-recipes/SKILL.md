description: Start, stop, or restart Workato recipes and view their run state, independently of push. Dev-only for mutations; on test/prod profiles it switches to guidance instead of executing. Japanese prompts are also supported.

# /run-recipes

Recipe run control as a first-class operation (spec S6-1〜S6-4): see what is running,
start/stop/restart without a push, and hand start failures to the diagnose loop.

## Usage

- `/run-recipes` — run-state overview of the current project (= `status`, read-only)
- `/run-recipes status [--project <name>]` — same, for a specific project
- `/run-recipes start|stop|restart --id <id>` — one recipe
- `/run-recipes start|stop|restart --all [--project <name>]` — every recipe in the project

## 0. Environment guard (mandatory before any start/stop/restart)

Resolve the active profile first:

```bash
python3 scripts/workato-api.py profile show
```

- **`status` is read-only and allowed against any environment.**
- **start / stop / restart are dev-only.** If the resolved profile name does not end
  with `-dev`, do **not** attempt the operation — switch to the prod-boundary guidance
  below. The plugin's PreToolUse hook and the helper's built-in dev guard would refuse
  anyway; they are the last line of defense, not the UX. This skill hands over *before*
  they fire.

### Prod boundary guidance (S6-3 — when asked to start/stop on test/prod)

Recipe control in test/prod is **always a human action in the Workato UI**
(the agent's test/prod API keys are read-only by design). Print, in one message:

1. **Why**: per-environment capability design — the agent can only mutate dev;
   test/prod changes go through the Deploy feature.
2. **What to operate**: the exact recipe name(s) and ID(s) (from `status`, which
   still works read-only).
3. **Where**: the Workato UI navigation — open the target environment → project →
   recipe → *Stop recipe* / *Start recipe*.
4. **What comes next**: if this is incident containment, the fix itself follows the
   hotfix path — fix in dev (`/diagnose-jobs`), then re-promote via `/deploy-project`
   (dev→test→prod, checklists included). There is no shortcut that edits prod directly.

## 1. status (default)

```bash
# folder_id comes from .workatoenv (with --project: `workato projects use "<name>"` first)
python3 scripts/workato-api.py recipes list --folder-id <folder_id>
```

Present a table: `ID / name / running|stopped`. Then flag anything suspicious:

- **Stopped but should be running** (e.g. it was pushed and started earlier, or other
  recipes in the same project run): call it out as a possible start failure and offer
  `/diagnose-jobs` (start-error entrance).
- Filter with `--status running` / `--status stopped` when the list is long.

## 2. start / stop

Always via the helper — it carries the dev guard and `--dry-run`:

```bash
python3 scripts/workato-api.py recipes start <id>
python3 scripts/workato-api.py recipes stop <id>
```

- `--all`: run `recipes list --folder-id <folder_id>` first, then loop over the
  returned IDs one by one (the helper takes a single recipe per call).
- Never wrap the raw CLI for this; the helper is the guarded path.

## 3. restart

Order is guaranteed: **stop → start**, per recipe, completing the stop before the
start. Use restart to roll out changes to running recipes when a push did not already
do it (`workato push --restart-recipes` covers the push case — do not duplicate it here).

## 4. After any operation

Re-run `status` and show the resulting state, so the report reflects reality rather
than the request ("started 3, running 3" / "started 3, 1 failed to start — see below").

## 5. Start failures (S6-4)

A recipe can fail to **start** even though push and validation succeeded (broken or
incomplete recipe definition, unassigned connection, trigger misconfiguration). A
recipe that never starts produces **no jobs**, so job-based checks stay silent.

On a start error:

1. Show the helper's error output verbatim.
2. Do not retry blindly — hand over to `/diagnose-jobs` (start-error entrance), which
   runs the fix → re-push → restart loop until the start succeeds.
3. If the cause is an unauthenticated connection, ask the user to authenticate in the
   Workato UI first, then start again.

## Notes

- Mutations are dev-only; `status` works everywhere the key can read.
- The helper supports `--dry-run` on start/stop — use it when the user wants a preview.
- This skill does not push. Pair with `/push-project` for deploys and `/deploy-project`
  for promotion.

# Workato CLI Tools

Pick the right one of three tools:

## 1. Platform CLI (project management)

Install: `pipx install workato-platform-cli`

Common commands:
- Init (bind an EXISTING Workato project to a local dir): `workato init --non-interactive --profile <profile> --project-id <id> --folder-name "projects/<name>"`
- Init (create a NEW project): `workato init --non-interactive --profile <profile> --project-name "<name>" --folder-name "projects/<name>"`
- Pull: `workato projects use "<name>" && workato pull`
- Push: `workato push`
- Push (with restart): `workato push --restart-recipes`
- Push (with delete): `workato push --delete`
- Start a recipe: `workato recipes start --id <id>` / `workato recipes start --all`

## 2. API helper (complements the CLI)

A script that fills the gaps in Platform CLI by calling the API directly. Profile auto-resolves from `workspace_id`.

> The helper and its templates are bundled in the plugin and materialized into the
> workspace by `/setup-workspace` (refresh with `/setup-workspace --update`).

```bash
python3 scripts/workato-api.py <command>
```

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `jobs list --recipe-id <id> [--status <s>]` | List jobs |
| `jobs get --recipe-id <id> --job-id <id>` | Job detail |
| `jobs tail --recipe-id <id>` | Follow a recipe's jobs (poll loop) |
| `connectors list-platform [--provider <name>]` | Pre-built connector info |
| `connectors list-custom` | List custom connectors |
| `recipes list [--folder-id <id>]` | List recipes (JSON) |
| `recipes start <id>` / `recipes stop <id>` | Start/stop with the dev-profile guard |
| `oauth-profiles list/get` | Custom OAuth profiles |
| `sdk push --connector <path> [--connector-id <id>]` | Push a custom connector (**recommended**) |
| `sdk pull (--connector-id <id> \| --name <name>)` | Pull a custom connector's source into `connectors/<name>/` |
| `sdk pull-project` / `sdk diff-project` | Pull / diff the WHOLE project via `workato pull` (all assets, not just connectors) |
| `sdk test <connector.rb>` | Lint a connector locally (`ruby -c` + structure check; runs no tests, no API call) |
| `sdk edit <file.enc>` / `sdk decrypt <file.enc>` / `sdk generate-schema` | Edit / decrypt any encrypted `.enc` file / schema from a JSON/CSV sample |
| `deploy preview/run/status/list` | Promote a project via the Deploy feature (dev→test→prod). Use through `/deploy-project` |
| `api-clients list/roles/create/delete/rotate` | Developer API clients — per-environment agent keys. Use through `/issue-api-keys` |
| `profile show` | Show the resolved profile |
| `--version` | Helper version (used by `/setup-workspace --update` staleness check) |

## 3. Connector SDK CLI (custom connector development & local testing)

Install: `gem install workato-connector-sdk`

**Note:** this gem ships a `workato` command that collides with Platform CLI. Always scope it with `bundle exec`.

```bash
cd connectors/<name>
bundle exec workato new <PATH>           # create
bundle exec workato exec <PATH> test     # local test
```

### Pushing a custom connector

**Use the API helper (recommended).** No Ruby needed; authenticates via Platform CLI's profile.

```bash
# First push
python3 scripts/workato-api.py sdk push --connector connectors/<name>/connector.rb --title "<Title>"
# Update an existing connector
python3 scripts/workato-api.py sdk push --connector connectors/<name>/connector.rb --connector-id <id>
```

> `bundle exec workato push` and `workato sdk push` also work, but the API helper is preferred for its profile auto-resolution and release automation.

### Pulling a custom connector

Mirror of `sdk push`: download a connector that already exists in the Workato workspace into the local repo.

```bash
# By connector ID
python3 scripts/workato-api.py sdk pull --connector-id <id>
# Or by connector name / title (resolved through list-custom)
python3 scripts/workato-api.py sdk pull --name <name>
```

Writes to `connectors/<name>/connector.rb` and stores `connector_id` in `connectors/docs/<name>.md` frontmatter so subsequent `sdk push` runs auto-update in place. Use `--force` to overwrite an existing `connector.rb`.

`--output-dir` overrides the destination, but it bypasses the canonical `connectors/` layout, so `connector_id` is **not** saved to docs frontmatter in that case — pass `--connector-id <id>` explicitly on the matching `sdk push`.

## Connector taxonomy

- **Pre-built**: Workato's official standard connectors (1,000+).
- **Universal**: HTTP, OpenAPI, GraphQL, SOAP — for APIs that don't have a standard connector.
- **Community**: connectors shared by other users.
- **Custom**: built with Connector SDK → lives in `connectors/`.
- **Custom Action**: in-connector `__adhoc_http_action` calls to hit an API directly.

## Pull / Push pitfalls

`workato pull` / `workato push` treats the Workato remote as the source of truth. If local naming or file structure doesn't match the remote's conventions, you can silently get renames / overwrites / duplicates. Always check the following.

### File naming and structure (before push)

- [ ] **Connection file name = snake_case of the display name (with the workspace name prefix)**
  - Example: display name `Key Broker | Workato Developer API` (workspace name = `Key Broker`) → file name `Connections/key_broker_workato_developer_api.connection.json`.
  - **If the display name does not start with the workspace name, Workato auto-prefixes it on push and renames the file.** The next `pull` then looks like "old file deleted, new file added", which causes confusion.
  - Workaround: decide on the display name as `<Workspace> | <Purpose>` first, then use its snake_case as the file name.
- [ ] **Data Table JSON: business columns only**
  - Do not write system columns (Record ID / Created time / Last modified time) locally. If you assign your own UUID, the remote assigns a different one and you get duplicates on pull.
  - System columns are fetched automatically by `workato pull`.
- [ ] **No credentials in `*.connection.json`** (Workato strips them automatically).

### Pre-pull checks

- [ ] Check for uncommitted changes with `git status`.
  - Pull overwrites and can delete local files — treat both as silent and
    unrecoverable; commit or stash before pulling.
  - Commit or stash any uncommitted edits before pulling.
- [ ] Ensure the project has a `.workatoignore`. The kit ships a base template at `templates/workatoignore.template` (covers `specs/`, `DESIGN.md`, `DESIGN.md.legacy.*`, catalog files, and `*.custom_adapter.{rb,json}`); the skills that need it (`/setup-workspace`, `/pull-project`, `/spec`, `/design`) place it automatically. Add any further project-specific exclusions to that file.

### Running `workato init` against an existing directory

- `workato init` refuses non-empty directories with `DIRECTORY_NOT_EMPTY` (there is no `--force`-style option).
- If you only need `.workatoenv` in a directory that already has `specs/` or `DESIGN.md`:

```bash
# Init into a temporary directory
workato init --non-interactive --profile <profile> --project-id <id> \
  --folder-name "projects/_tmp_init_$$"

# Move only .workatoenv into the real directory
mv "projects/_tmp_init_$$/.workatoenv" "projects/<name>/"
rm -rf "projects/_tmp_init_$$"
```

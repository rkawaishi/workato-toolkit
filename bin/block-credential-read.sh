# block-credential-read.sh — PreToolUse hook (Claude Code).
#
# Blocks every tool call that would read or shell-access a credential file
# (patterns in credential-patterns.txt). Covers Read / Edit / Write /
# NotebookEdit / Grep / Glob via tool_input paths, and Bash via command-string
# scanning.
#
# The Bash layer uses a surfacing model: it blocks only commands that would
# emit a credential file's CONTENT into the agent context, not every command
# that merely names one. See credential-patterns.txt for the model.
#
# Defense-in-depth: the .claude/settings.json permissions.deny list also
# blocks these tools, but that list has known enforcement bugs in some Claude
# Code versions. This hook is the reliable enforcement layer.
#
# The embedded Python decides AND emits the user-facing message itself, then
# exits 2 (block) or 0 (allow). The wrapper deliberately does NOT capture the
# output via $(...): a quoted heredoc inside command substitution makes bash
# scan the body for quote/paren balance, so a stray ' " or ( in a comment
# breaks the whole script. Running the heredoc directly avoids that entirely.
